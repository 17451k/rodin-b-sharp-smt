\begin{abstract}

The Rodin platform \cite{RODIN} mainly supports two kind of activities: modeling with the event-B notation and discharging the sequents generated from the models. 
Some sequents are typical mathematical lemmas, which are often encountered in practice, but are not yet well supported by proving tools such as those embedded in the Rodin platform.
The objective of the task 7 is to integrate SMT solvers to the Rodin proving framework to enhance its proving capability, especially in the field of arithmetics.

\section{Introduction}
The document will first...

\paragraph{}
This integration raises several issues:
\begin{itemize}
\item A translation scheme from the event-B mathematical notation (i.e. set-theory and arithmetics) to the formalism(s) understood by the decision procedures needs to be defined. Of course, not all
concepts of the event-B mathematical language will be translatable, as it has the same expressive
power as higher-order logic.
\item A filtering mechanism is needed, so that decision procedures are attempted (either automatically or interactively) only in cases where they could be useful. This mechanism will have strong links with the translation, as it would be useless to launch the reasoner on an untranslatable lemma.
\item The Rodin prover insists that reasoners return a minimal set of needed hypotheses, in order to foster proof reuse. Fortunately, this information can be extracted from the decision procedure
traces or certificates, as one purpose of such artefacts is to memorize this information.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

\paragraph{Future work.} 

TO BE DONE.
Etablir un lien entre les hypothèses au format Event-B et les hypothèses au format SMT.
Remonter les contre-exemples et preuves SMT dans Rodin.
Conseiller l'emploi de tel solveur.
+ Autre idée:
As suggested in the previous examples, it seems
pertinent to introduce an additional step before the final 
translation from FOL to SMT-LIB, which would be a 
simplification operation on FOL formulas. More precisely,
there is no doubt that the $(0 >= 0) \wedge (0 <= x)$
formula can be easily simplified as $0 <= x$.

Such simplifications are not considered in this document, 
and are only introduced here as topic of interest for 
further revisions.

Compiling veriT on Mac OS X
---------------------------

Fetch the following tarballs:

  http://www.verit-solver.org/distrib/veriT-stable2016.tar.gz

Make sure that the GMP library is not installed locally.

Uncompress the veriT tarball and enter the commands:

  cd veriT-stable2016
  patch -p1 < ../veriT-stable2016.patch
  autoconf
  ./configure

Ensure that you see the line

  config.status: executing extern-gmp commands

If you do not see it, it means that you have a libgmp installed on your
computer.  Deactivate it (e.g., brew unlink gmp).

  make

The binary file `veriT` is the compiled solver.  Check its dependencies with

  otool -L veriT

This shall answer something like

  veriT:
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (...)

with no dependency beyond the system library.

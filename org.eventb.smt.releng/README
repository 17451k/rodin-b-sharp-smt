Procedure for building a new version of the SMT feature
-------------------------------------------------------

This build procedure assumes that the build happens on a Linux platform.
Nevertheless, the feature will be built for all target platforms
supported by Rodin.

1. Create an empty directory and copy all ".sh" files of the
   "org.eventb.smt.releng" project into it.

2. Copy the Eclipse SDK distribution and delta pack in directory "archives".

   Example:

	archives/eclipse-SDK-3.7.2-linux-gtk.tar.gz
	archives/eclipse-3.7.2-delta-pack.zip

3. Copy the target Rodin platform in directory "archives".

   Example:

	archives/rodin-2.7-linux.gtk.x86.zip

4. Update the header of file config.sh with the necessary information.
   Do not forget to set the right Git commit.

5. Fetch the sources from Git on SourceForge by running script
   "fetch.sh" from the current directory.  The sources are fetched and
   stored in directory "src". In addition, an archive of the sources is
   stored in directory "result".

   Example:
	./fetch.sh
	./fetch.sh org.eventb.smt.core

6. Run the build script from the current directory.

   Example:
	./build.sh

7. A Zipped p2 repository containing the feature and plug-ins is
   available in directory "result".

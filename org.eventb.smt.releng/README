Procedure for building a new version of the SMT feature
-------------------------------------------------------

This build procedure assumes that the build happens on a Linux platform.
Nevertheless, the feature will be built for all target platforms
supported by Rodin.

1. Copy the Eclipse SDK distribution and delta pack in directory "archives".

   Example:

	archives/eclipse-SDK-3.7.2-linux-gtk.tar.gz
	archives/eclipse-3.7.2-delta-pack.zip

2. Copy the target Rodin platform in directory "archives".

   Example:

	archives/rodin-2.5-dev.zip

3. Update the header of file config.sh with the necessary information.

4. Fetch the sources from Subversion on SourceForge by running script
   "fetch.sh" from the current directory.  The sources are fetched and
   stored in directory "src". In addition, an archive of the sources is
   stored in directory "result".

   It happens frequently that Subversion fails at downloading some
   projects with a "Connection reset" error.  In this case, just rerun
   the fetch script with the project name as argument to repair.

   Example:
	./fetch.sh
	./fetch.sh org.eventb.smt.core

5. Run the build script from the current directory.

   Example:
	./build.sh

6. A Zipped p2 repository containing the feature and plug-ins is
   available in directory "result".
